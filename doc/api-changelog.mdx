## About

Below is a log of changes to the CCCambox Reseller API. Updates that affect only products or features in beta or limited release may not be reflected.

Each change can be described as either a breaking change or an ongoing change.

- **Breaking changes = new API version:** When any backwards-incompatible changes are made, a new version of the API is released. These changes are marked in the changelog with the 💥 symbol. Users have control over when they upgrade their API version to receive breaking changes. Learn how to try out and upgrade to newer API versions.
- **Ongoing changes:** Ongoing changes are backwards-compatible and are added on a continuous basis. There is no need to update the API version to receive these updates.
